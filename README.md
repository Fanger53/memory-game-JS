## 👩🏼‍💻 About My Restaurant Page

This is a restaurant page that was created with HTML and JavasCript, The HTML just contains in the body a div with an id= " content" and the whole content of the page is made with JavasCript. This project was created to learn about modularized code and how to work with modules using webpack.
